# Design
The design of website was done such as to make it intuitive and user friendly.
Grouping option has been done like in case of addition of social links to simplify what's already available on platform like LinkedIn.
Also the process of addition of achievements has been made simpler while maintaining details of necessary information.
The overall ui has a soft friendly touch to it to not make it too daunting for a first time user and make it easy to comprehend at the same time.
Made Design Responsive so it can be accessible on laptop and mobile as well.

I've used NextJs for Framework and Postgres for database although not completely implement backend but added basic get and add user api routes.
i've focused more on UI for making it more clean minimal and user friendly.

# Improvements
can introduce s3 or cloudinary for image storing. not storing image in any platform yet
add complete backend routes so user can actually update data in database
make ui components more reusable
